# Generative AI-Based Fashion Recommender System

## Project Overview
This project leverages Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro API to create a personalized fashion recommender system. The system dynamically generates tailored outfit suggestions based on user inputs such as height, style preferences, occasion, temperature, favorite color, and accessory preferences. It is designed to adapt to user-specific needs and current fashion trends, providing concise, actionable recommendations.
